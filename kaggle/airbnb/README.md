# Overview
Instead of waking to overlooked "Do not disturb" signs, Airbnb travelers find themselves rising with the birds in a whimsical treehouse, 
having their morning coffee on the deck of a houseboat, or cooking a shared regional breakfast with their hosts.
New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book 
their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first 
booking, and better forecast demand.
In this recruiting competition, Airbnb challenges you to predict in which country a new user will make his or her first booking. Kagglers 
who impress with their answer (and an explanation of how they got there) will be considered for an interview for the opportunity to join 
Airbnb's Data Science and Analytics team.
